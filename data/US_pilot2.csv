1.   Too much attention focuses on things that will not enough of a difference
2.    How do we control the major problems,  when the industrial production is primarily happening in other countries.
3.  Take into account what COVID has shown us.   Dramatic drops in personal energy consumption are not sufficient to dent the problem.
4.   We need to save,  in order to be able to fund the expected future expenses caused by climate change.   Analysis of what constitutes reasonable debt size seems to be flawed by not taking into account ability to respond to unexpected events.
This includes more than the just future climate impact costs.
5.   There needs to be more of a pivot from stopping climate change,  to making progess on the major sources of human carbon emissions.  There needs to be more national planning for the expected future costs.
